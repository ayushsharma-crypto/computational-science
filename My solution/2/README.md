# Estimating Pi using Monte Carlo

* Performed monte carlo simluation for calculating value of `PI`
* Formula Used :
    ```
    π ≈ 4 x (number of points in the circle / total number of points)
    ```

**Executing the code :**

    Run command : `python3 code.py`


**Output :**

    There will be a graph output for PI va N as attached.
    Time of simulation : ~3-6 minutes
